# ElecraftController
Very simple controller app for Elecraft radios for OS X. Uses ORSSerialPort.

This application was written as a very simple demo application in response to an email from someone trying to write a similar (but more full featured app). It is meant to be used as sample code for ORSSerialPort, mostly. I'm releasing it in the hope that it might be useful, but without any warranty or offer of support whatsoever.
